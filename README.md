This is basically a frankenstein extension - I used [@MethodGrab](https://github.com/methodgrab]'s [Firefox Custom New Tab](https://github.com/MethodGrab/firefox-custom-new-tab-page) extension as a base to get started and added the source files from [@williamyeny](https://github.com/williamyeny/)'s original [Pastel Tab](https://github.com/williamyeny/pastel-tab) extension for Chrome.
